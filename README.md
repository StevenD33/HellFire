HellFire is a tool for system-hardening your UNIX system. 
it works with python 3.7


The command for starting it is :
	`sudo python3.7 Hellfire.py`

you need to run it in `sudo` 

You can audit your system with it but you will need lynis for running the audit-script 

    apt-get install lynis

it is currently in 1.0 more features will come later
